üëã Hello there! This repository hosts the source code for my personal portfolio web application, a dynamic showcase of my data science projects, skills, educational background, STEM outreach endeavors, and ways to connect.

Inspired by the elegant design and functionality demonstrated in [gcastano's Streamlit Portfolio](https://github.com/gcastano/Streamlit-Demo-Apps/tree/main/streamlitPortfolio), I've tailored this web app to reflect my unique journey and accomplishments in the world of data science.

‚ú® **Key Features:**

* **My Skills:** A visually engaging display of my technical proficiencies and areas of expertise.
* **My Projects:** An in-depth look at the data science projects I've undertaken, highlighting methodologies, technologies used, and outcomes.
* **Education:** Details about my academic background.
* **STEM Content Creation & Outreach:** Showcasing my contributions to the STEM community through content creation and outreach activities.
* **Contact:** Easy ways to get in touch with me for collaborations or opportunities.

üõ†Ô∏è **Built With:**

* **Streamlit:** The magic framework that makes building interactive web apps purely in Python a breeze.
* **Python:** The versatile and powerful language at the heart of all the logic and functionality.
* **MaterializeCSS:** A modern responsive CSS framework that provides a clean and intuitive user interface.

üöÄ **Live Demo:**
