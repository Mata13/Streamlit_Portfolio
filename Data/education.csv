Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México,"B.Sc. Earth Sciences, Space Sciences","My core data science capabilities are built on a rigorous quantitative foundation developed through advanced coursework such as Statistics, Numerical Methods, Partial Differential Equations, Computational Physics, Machine Learning Applied to Physics, Dynamical Systems, and Graph Theory Applied to Physics. I leverage these disciplines to solve complex data challenges and derive actionable insights.
#My Earth and Space Sciences background provides an additional analytical perspective for tackling data problems. Through advanced coursework in Geodynamics, Geochemistry, Thermodynamics, Differential Equations, Numerical Modeling of the Atmosphere, Space Physics, Electromagnetism, and Quantum Mechanics, I have honed my ability to interpret multidimensional datasets and model physical systems effectively.
#I served as a Teaching Assistant for ""Applied Statistics to Earth Sciences,"" where I mentored students in statistical methodologies, data visualization best practices, and quantitative problem-solving. This role significantly enhanced my ability to simplify complex concepts and communicate technical information effectively.
#My academic work involved analyzing Space Weather and Solar Physics data to conduct statistical analysis of solar wind component distributions during Geomagnetic Storms. I then visualized these findings in a research poster, presented at the 2015 Annual Meeting of the Unión Geofísica Mexicana (RAUGM). This project honed my skills in data extraction, quantitative analysis, and scientific communication.
#My bachelor’s thesis focused on numerical simulations using the Monte Carlo method in CORSIKA to investigate how Cosmic Rays interact with Earth’s atmosphere. I leveraged Python to process and analyze the CORSIKA outputs, creating comprehensive visualizations that illustrate the distribution of secondary particles across different altitude profiles. This project enhanced my proficiency in data analysis, scientific programming, simulation data processing, and in conveying complex scientific results through clear visual representations.",2021
Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México,B.Sc. Mathematics,"Built a strong quantitative foundation through formal coursework in Calculus, Differential Equations, Graph Theory, Algebra, and Mathematical Logic, complemented by self-directed study in Mathematical Analysis and Functional Analysis.
#Enhanced my statistical and computational skillset with targeted courses in Inferential Statistics, Linear Algebra, and Probability, applying these methods to real-world data challenges.
#Pursued advanced independent learning in Differential Geometry, Measure Theory, Manifolds, and Metric Spaces to bridge theoretical mathematics with modern data science techniques.
#Attended the “Geometric Intelligence Workshop 2025” at IMATE UNAM in collaboration with UC Santa Barbara, gaining hands-on experience with advanced topics in data science and applied mathematics, including Topological Deep Learning, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Riemannian Geometry, and Geometric Statistics using Python’s Geomstats library. During the final hackathon, my team developed a neural graph network to predict ADHD diagnoses from brain imaging data of women, applying geometric deep learning techniques to extract meaningful patterns—highlighting my ability to integrate cutting-edge theory with real-world data-driven solutions.",2022
